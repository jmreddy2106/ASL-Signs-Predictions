# ASL-Signs-Predictions
This porject based on CSE 574 - Introduction to Machine Learning

The task of this project is to perform classification using machine learning. It is for a two class problem. Your task is to classify what ASL word is performed by an ASL signer, based on the acoustic images provided in the dataset, using Convolutional neural network as the classifier. The code should be written in Python.

This dataset is provided by our current research project, which include 10 ASL words performed by 5 subjects. In this dataset, all images are generated by using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to calculate a spectrogram as the feature representation of the reflected near-ultrasound waves. Based on the Doppler effect, sign language gestures, including both hands and arms, will cause phase and frequency changes of the reflected sonic wave.
